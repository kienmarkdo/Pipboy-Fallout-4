# Pipboy-Fallout-4
My first front-end web development project where I create a clone of the "Pipboy" from the game "Fallout 4"!

## Purpose
As this is my first summer as a university student, I decided to dedicate some of my spare time to learn front-end development. My goal was to make something cool with what I was learning so that I could not only put my skills to good use, but also to have fun while doing it!

Also, I had joined my first hackathon, the uOttaHack 4 hackathon, at the beginning of 2021 with limited practical skills. As such, I could not contribute as much as I would have liked to. By doing a project like this, I'm positive that I will be more confident and better prepared for future hackathons.

## Concepts applied
The project is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery.
Thanks to CSS flexbox and Bootstrap, the Pipboy clone is 100% compatible across all devices and screensizes.
Version control is done entirely using git BASH.

## Lessons Learned
- Gained a significantly deeper understanding of page structure, containers, grids; much more comfortable with HTML and CSS.
- Obtained a stronger grasp of the jQuery library and the Bootstrap 4 library after going through trial and error and reading the documentation on my own.
- Overall, I am much more confident with front-end development.
