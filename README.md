# Pipboy-Fallout-4
My first personal front-end web development project where I get to apply the front-end skills I learned in the past month to create something cool - such as a clone of the
"Pipboy" from the game "Fallout 4"! 

This is an idea which I shamelessly borrowed from the Udemy course "The Complete Front-End Web Development Course!" by Nick Germaine.

## Purpose
I had some free time as this is my first summer as a university student so I decided to learn some practical front-end skills. This project allowed me to put the skills I learned
into good use. 

I had also joined the uOttaHack 4 hackathon at the beginning of 2021 with limited practical skills so I hope that this will be a good stepping stone for me to reach the 
goal of being hackathon-ready for 2022.


## Concepts applied
The project is built using HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap.
Thanks to CSS flexbox and Bootstrap, this bad boi is 100% compatible across all devices and screensizes.
Version control is done entirely using git BASH.
